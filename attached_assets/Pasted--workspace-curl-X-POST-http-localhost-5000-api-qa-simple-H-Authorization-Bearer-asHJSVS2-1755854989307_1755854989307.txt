{"question":"What phone numbers are available for SMS campaigns in Brazil?","answer":"For Brazil, SMS campaigns typically work best with a locally scoped approach that aligns with Brazilian carrier rules and consumer expectations. Key considerations include opt-in/opt-out compliance, message content restrictions, and carrier-based rate limits. In Brazil, long-code (local) numbers are widely used for two-way SMS campaigns and generally provide good deliverability for promotional messaging when you follow Brazilian regulations. Short Codes and 10DLC are primarily US/Canada-centric and are not standard offerings for Brazil through Twilio, so relying on those types for Brazil campaigns can lead to compliance and availability issues. Alphanumeric sender IDs can be used in some markets for one-way branding messages, but they do not support two-way messaging and replies from customers. If you need broader branding with potential replies, a local SMS-enabled number is typically the recommended option. Always ensure explicit customer opt-in, provide a clear unsubscribe mechanism, and comply with local regulations on content, frequency, and consent. Work with Twilio to confirm live, SMS-capable availability for Brazil numbers and to verify current carrier requirements before launching campaigns.","recommendedNumbers":[{"geo":"BR","type":"Local","smsEnabled":true,"voiceEnabled":true,"considerations":"Best for two-way marketing campaigns; ensure Brazilian opt-in, proper unsubscribe handling, and compliant message content.
