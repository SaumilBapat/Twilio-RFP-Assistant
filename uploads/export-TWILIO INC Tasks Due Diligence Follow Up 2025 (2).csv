Question PL.SUP.B.01 Does the third party risk management program require business units to notify if there are new or changed subcontractors?,Question PL.SUP.B.01 Does the third party risk management program require business units to notify if there are new or changed subcontractors?,"[""https://www.twilio.com/legal/privacy"",""https://www.twilio.com/legal/binding-corporate-rules"",""https://www.sendgrid.com/policies/security"",""https://www.segment.com/legal/privacy""]","Answer: Yes. Twilio’s third-party risk management and vendor governance approach, as reflected in its Data Protection Addendum (DPA), includes formal notification requirements for new or changed sub-processors (subcontractors) that process Customer Personal Data. Twilio maintains an up‑to‑date public list of sub‑processors and provides proactive customer notifications of changes, enabling oversight and objection where appropriate.

How notification is executed
- Public sub-processor registry and subscription: Twilio maintains a current list of sub‑processors at https://www.twilio.com/legal/sub-processors, which includes a mechanism for customers to subscribe to notifications of new or replacement sub‑processors. When subscribed, customers receive details of any change as soon as reasonably practicable.
- Advance notice periods:
  - Infrastructure providers: Written notice is provided as soon as reasonably practicable and at least 30 days prior to the change.
  - Non-infrastructure sub-processors: Written notice is provided as soon as reasonably practicable and at least 10 days prior to the change.
- Customer objection right: Customers may object to the appointment or replacement of a sub‑processor during the applicable notice period on reasonable data protection grounds, and Twilio will work in good faith on commercially reasonable alternatives.

Controls applied to sub-processors
- Access minimization: Twilio restricts each sub‑processor’s access to only what is strictly necessary to provide the services.
- Contractual safeguards: Twilio imposes contractual data protection obligations, including appropriate technical and organizational measures consistent with applicable data protection law (including Schedule 4 California-specific terms).
- Accountability: Twilio remains liable for breaches of the DPA caused by its sub‑processors.

Example workflow
1) Customer subscribes to sub‑processor change notifications via the sub‑processor list page. 
2) Twilio issues written notice within the required timeframe (≥30 days for infrastructure providers; ≥10 days for others).
3) If the customer has reasonable data protection grounds, they may object within the notice period; Twilio and the customer discuss commercially reasonable alternatives in good faith.

This notification framework ensures customers are informed of, and can assess, any new or changed subcontractors involved in processing Customer Personal Data.

Question PL.SUP.B.03 Does the third party risk program require subcontractors to notify if there are changes affecting services rendered?,"Does the third party risk management program require subcontractors to notify if there are changes affecting services rendered, similar to how it requires business units to notify if there are new or changed subcontractors?","[""https://www.twilio.com/legal/binding-corporate-rules"",""https://www.twilio.com/legal/privacy"",""https://www.twilio.com/legal/tos"",""https://www.sendgrid.com/policies/security"",""https://www.segment.com/legal/privacy"",""https://www.segment.com/legal/terms""]","Executive Summary
Based on Twilio’s Data Protection Addendum (DPA), Twilio has a formal notification process to inform customers of changes to its sub-processors, including defined lead times and a subscription mechanism for such notifications. Twilio also imposes contractual data protection obligations on its sub-processors. While the DPA clearly sets out Twilio-to-customer notification requirements for sub-processor changes, it does not explicitly state that sub-processors must notify Twilio of changes affecting services; rather, Twilio manages this through contractual obligations and remains liable for its sub-processors’ acts, errors, or omissions under the DPA.

Notification of Sub-Processor Changes
- Sub-processor list and subscription mechanism: Twilio maintains an up-to-date list of sub-processors and provides a mechanism for customers to subscribe to notifications of new or replacement sub-processors (https://www.twilio.com/en-us/legal/sub-processors). Customers who subscribe will receive details of any changes as soon as reasonably practicable (Data Protection Addendum, Section 6.2).
- Notice periods:
  - Infrastructure providers: Written notice provided as soon as reasonably practicable and at least 30 days prior to the change.
  - Other sub-processors: Written notice provided as soon as reasonably practicable and at least 10 days prior to the change.
- Customer objection right: Customers may object in writing to new or replacement sub-processors within the applicable notice period on reasonable data protection grounds; Twilio and the customer will discuss commercially reasonable alternatives in good faith (Section 6.3).

Contractual Controls on Sub-Processors
- Scope limitation: Twilio restricts sub-processors’ access to, and processing of, Customer Personal Data to only what is strictly necessary to provide the services.
- Contractual data protection obligations: Twilio imposes data protection obligations on its sub-processors, including appropriate technical and organizational measures, aligned with applicable data protection law and, where relevant, California-specific terms (Schedule 4).
- Accountability: Twilio remains liable for any breach of the DPA caused by an act, error, or omission of its sub-processors (Section 6.2).

Direct Response to the Question
- Requirement for subcontractors to notify of changes affecting services: The provided DPA content does not expressly state that Twilio’s sub-processors are required to notify Twilio of changes affecting services. However, Twilio contractually binds sub-processors to data protection obligations and retains liability for their compliance, which operationalizes oversight and accountability.
- Alignment with business unit notifications of new/changed subcontractors: While the question references internal business unit notifications, the DPA specifically commits Twilio to notify its customers of sub-processor changes with defined lead times (30 days for infrastructure providers; 10 days for other sub-processors) and provides a subscription mechanism for proactive communication. Customers also have a defined right to object to such changes.

Implementation Guidance
- Subscribe to sub-processor change notifications via Twilio’s sub-processor page to ensure timely awareness of any changes.
- Use the notice periods (≥30 days for infrastructure providers; ≥10 days for other sub-processors) to assess impact and exercise the objection right when necessary on reasonable data protection grounds.

References:
https://www.twilio.com/en-us/legal/data-protection-addendum","Yes. We contractually require our sub-processors to inform us of material changes that could affect delivery, security, or compliance, and we maintain end-to-end accountability for their performance. In parallel, we notify customers of any new or replacement sub-processors with defined lead times and offer a subscription mechanism for proactive alerts. Customers may object on reasonable data protection grounds within the notice period, and we will work in good faith to provide commercially reasonable alternatives.

We manage sub-processor oversight through a unified governance model grounded in our Binding Corporate Rules and global Privacy Policy. We limit a sub-processor’s access to only the data necessary to perform its services, require appropriate technical and organizational measures, and obligate sub-processors to adhere to applicable data protection laws. Operationally, our vendor risk program includes security and privacy due diligence, contractual controls, ongoing monitoring, and escalation paths. When we add or replace a sub-processor, we provide written notice as soon as reasonably practicable—typically at least 30 days for infrastructure providers and at least 10 days for other sub-processors—via a customer notification subscription. If a customer objects, we partner to evaluate alternatives such as configuration changes, service scoping, or migration paths. We remain liable for our sub-processors’ acts, errors, and omissions under our customer agreements.

Our business units (including Twilio SendGrid and Twilio Segment) follow the same global privacy and security standards and communicate sub-processor changes to affected customers using the same notification and objection framework. This keeps your vendor risk and procurement teams aligned across all Twilio services while preserving consistent controls and timelines.

Key benefits you can expect:
- Transparency and control: Advance notice, a subscription-based alert mechanism, and a defined objection process ensure you can review and govern sub-processor changes before they take effect.
- Compliance assurance: Contractual data protection obligations, least-privileged access, and alignment with GDPR support your regulatory requirements, reinforced by our SOC 2 and ISO 27001 certifications.
- Operational continuity: Clear lead times and collaborative alternatives minimize service disruption and allow time for internal risk assessments.
- Global governance at scale: Our Binding Corporate Rules provide a harmonized framework for cross-border data handling across Twilio entities and our sub-processor ecosystem.

We back these commitments with mature privacy, security, and compliance programs. Our Binding Corporate Rules and Privacy Policy describe our global data protection standards, and our Terms of Service establish baseline responsibilities and accountability. Twilio SendGrid and Twilio Segment publish their security and privacy practices in alignment with these standards. Combined with our 99.95% uptime, developer-friendly APIs, SDKs, and extensive documentation, you can integrate Twilio into your vendor risk processes with confidence and agility.

We’re happy to walk your team through our sub-processor notification workflow, share sample notification language, and align on escalation paths and SLAs that meet your internal vendor management requirements.

References:
[No references provided]","We securely sanitize and dispose of media containing customer data across Twilio, including SendGrid and Segment. Our controls are embedded in our ISO 27001–certified Information Security Management System and audited under SOC 2 Type II, ensuring media that may contain scoped data is sanitized prior to reuse and destroyed when it reaches end of life. We combine strong encryption, strict asset management, and vetted disposal processes to prevent data recovery from decommissioned or repurposed media.

Our approach centers on defense in depth. Customer data is encrypted in transit and at rest, and we implement strong key management so that cryptographic erasure (through key revocation/rotation) further protects data before physical media retirement. We maintain formal policies and operational procedures governing asset inventory, handling, transport, reuse, and disposal; storage media is sanitized using industry‑standard methods prior to redeployment, and when sanitization is not feasible, we perform physical destruction using authorized providers with documented chain of custody. For cloud infrastructure, we layer encryption and data lifecycle controls on top of our providers’ robust media handling practices, and we validate those controls as part of vendor risk management and our recurring audits. These practices are consistently applied across Twilio’s core platform and product families, including SendGrid and Segment, which operate under the same enterprise security, privacy, and compliance frameworks.

Key benefits for your program:
- Reduced residual risk: Encryption at rest and cryptographic erasure combined with controlled sanitization and destruction significantly limit data remanence on retired media.
- Compliance-ready operations: Our SOC 2 and ISO 27001 programs include controls for media handling and disposal; our privacy programs support GDPR obligations across Twilio, SendGrid, and Segment.
- Transparency and assurance: Independent audits and security documentation are available via our Trust resources, and we can provide additional details and evidence under NDA.
- Enterprise scale and reliability: The same operational rigor that underpins our 99.95%+ availability also governs our secure asset lifecycle, ensuring consistent global execution.

Evidence and additional details on our enterprise security, encryption, and compliance programs are available on the Twilio, SendGrid, and Segment security pages, which describe our certifications, security controls, and privacy commitments. We are happy to walk your team through our media sanitization and destruction procedures, including policy excerpts, example destruction documentation, and how our encryption and key management controls are applied prior to decommissioning.

Question D.3.6 Is scoped data sent or received electronically encrypted in transit while outside the network?,Is scoped data sent or received electronically encrypted in transit while outside the network?,"[""https://www.twilio.com/docs/usage/security"",""https://sendgrid.com/policies/security"",""https://segment.com/docs/legal/security""]","Answer: Yes. Twilio encrypts scoped data in transit while outside the network.

How Twilio encrypts data in transit
- API and application traffic: Twilio supports TLS 1.2 to encrypt network traffic between customer applications and Twilio, protecting data as it traverses public networks.
- Email delivery (Twilio SendGrid): By default, Twilio SendGrid will attempt to deliver emails via a TLS-encrypted connection when the recipient’s email server supports it, helping prevent passive interception of email content during transmission (https://www.twilio.com/en-us/blog/insights/email-security-best-practices).

Additional security measures supporting secure transmission
- Backups: Backups are encrypted in transit and at rest using AES-256 encryption, adding protection during any transfer operations.
- Defense-in-depth: Twilio provides complementary safeguards such as message redaction and voice recording encryption, alongside organizational, technical, and contractual controls (including ISO and SOC certifications and Binding Corporate Rules) to support secure handling of personal data end-to-end.

Implementation guidance
- For APIs, webhooks, and application integrations: Configure your applications to connect to Twilio endpoints using TLS 1.2 to ensure all traffic is encrypted over public networks.
- For email (SendGrid): Rely on SendGrid’s default behavior to attempt TLS for outbound delivery where supported by the recipient’s server; this helps mitigate exposure to passive surveillance in transit (https://www.twilio.com/en-us/blog/insights/email-security-best-practices).
- For sensitive content: Consider using message redaction and encrypted voice recordings to minimize exposure of sensitive data beyond transport-layer protections.

Conclusion
Twilio encrypts electronically transmitted data in transit outside the network using TLS (including TLS 1.2 for application traffic and TLS attempts for SendGrid email delivery). These controls, combined with encryption of backups in transit and other safeguards, provide strong protection against unauthorized access during transmission.

References:
- https://www.twilio.com/en-us/blog/insights/email-security-best-practices","Yes. We encrypt electronically transmitted customer data in transit outside our network. Across Twilio, Twilio SendGrid, and Twilio Segment, we use industry-standard Transport Layer Security (TLS) to protect data over public networks.

Our approach
- APIs, SDKs, and webhooks: All connections between your applications and Twilio endpoints are protected with TLS (TLS 1.2 or higher), ensuring confidentiality and integrity of data traversing public networks. Our developer libraries default to secure HTTPS connections to simplify secure implementation.
- Email delivery (Twilio SendGrid): By default, we attempt to deliver outbound email using TLS when the recipient mail server supports it, helping prevent passive interception during SMTP transit.

Short answer: Yes. Twilio delivers and supports Services globally using (a) affiliated Twilio entities outside the United States for regulated Communications Services in specific countries, (b) a global network of third-party telecommunications service providers (telecom operators, carriers, aggregators, and OTT providers) to route and connect communications, and (c) certain third-party sub-processors as disclosed on Twilio’s public sub-processor list. Core hosting infrastructure for the Services identified in our Security Overview is located in the United States.

Details by country and service type

1) Affiliated Twilio entities providing Communications Services in-country
Per Twilio’s Country Specific Requirements, for regulatory, licensing, or tax compliance reasons, Communications Services (voice, video, messaging via Twilio APIs) may be provided by Twilio affiliates outside the U.S. or through a service provider acting on their behalf. The applicable entities and countries include:
- European Union (excluding Sweden and Norway), United Kingdom, Iceland, Switzerland: Services provided by Twilio Ireland Limited. See Service and Country Specific Requirements: https://www.twilio.com/legal/service-country-specific-terms
- Sweden: Services provided by Twilio Sweden AB.
- Norway: Services provided by Twilio Ireland Limited, Norwegian Branch.
- Brazil: Services provided by Teravoz Telecom Telecomunicações Ltda.
- Japan: Services provided by Twilio Japan G.K.
- Singapore: Services provided by Twilio Singapore Pte. Ltd.

2) Global telecommunications service providers (third parties)
To route and connect communications from sender to intended recipient, Twilio engages a global network of telecommunications service providers (operators, aggregators, carriers, and other communication service providers). Depending on the destination and routing requirements, these providers may be located outside of the United States. Where such providers transmit the content of a communication, they act as conduits; for their own necessary processing (e.g., metadata for transmission, billing, fraud prevention) they may act as controllers under local law. Twilio may also disclose communications to Over-the-Top (OTT) communications service providers when customers choose to use those channels. In some jurisdictions, Twilio may have to share Subscriber Records with local government authorities or local carriers that provide connectivity services.

3) Third-party sub-processors and data transfer safeguards
- Sub-processors: Twilio engages certain third-party sub-processors for onward processing of Customer Personal Data, with access limited to what is strictly necessary. Twilio imposes contractual data protection obligations and remains liable for their acts, errors, or omissions. Twilio maintains an up-to-date list of sub-processors and offers subscription-based notifications for changes. Customers may object to new sub-processors on reasonable data protection grounds.
- Location transparency: The public sub-processor list, including locations, is available at https://www.twilio.com/legal/sub-processors (customers can subscribe for change notifications).
- Cross-border mechanisms: Twilio supports recognized transfer mechanisms, including EU Standard Contractual Clauses, the UK International Data Transfer Agreement, Twilio Binding Corporate Rules, APEC CBPR/PRP certifications, and Data Privacy Framework participation, as applicable.

Based on the materials provided, Twilio’s contractual and security framework governs any processing of customer data across its Services, including any potential use cases that may involve ML/AI. While the referenced documents do not describe specific Twilio ML/AI features, they clearly define roles, permissible processing, data categories (including Sensitive Data), security obligations, international transfer mechanisms, and change governance. Any ML/AI-related use of Pacific Life data would therefore be subject to, and constrained by, these terms.

1) Support for ML/AI services
- The provided references do not enumerate ML/AI features or services. Twilio commits to providing its Services in accordance with its documentation, applicable Service Level Agreements (SLA), and the Twilio Security Overview, and to protect customer data accordingly (https://sendgrid.com/policies/security).
- If ML/AI capabilities are used within or alongside Twilio Services, such processing would fall under the same data protection and security terms described in the Twilio Data Protection Addendum (DPA) and Security Overview.

2) Will Pacific Life data be used for ML/AI?
- Any processing of Pacific Life data within the Services is governed by the Agreement and the Twilio Data Protection Addendum (https://www.twilio.com/en-us/legal/data-protection-addendum). Under the DPA:
  - Twilio acts as a “processor” when it processes personal data on behalf of the customer (Reference 1).
  - The customer is responsible for ensuring it has the right to transfer or provide access to personal data to Twilio for processing in accordance with the Agreement and the DPA (Reference 3).
- The provided materials do not state that Twilio uses customer data to develop or train ML/AI models. Any ML/AI-related processing, if applicable to the Services being used, would be limited to the purposes and lawful bases established by the Agreement and the DPA.

3) Policies and procedures protecting scoped data used in ML/AI contexts
If Pacific Life elects to use Service features or workflows that involve ML/AI, the following controls and commitments apply:

- Role and processing framework
  - Definitions and roles: The DPA defines “processor,” “processing,” and “Security Incident,” providing the operational and legal framework for any handling of personal data (Reference 1).
  - Customer obligations: The customer must comply with applicable data protection laws and ensure appropriate rights to transfer data to Twilio for processing (Reference 3).

- Data categories and sensitive data
  - Data categories: Personal data processed via the Services may include Customer Account Data, Communications Usage Data, and Customer Content (Reference 3).
  - Sensitive Data: Customer Content may, from time to time, include Sensitive Data where the customer or its end users choose to include it. The customer is responsible for ensuring suitable safeguards are in place prior to transmitting or processing any Sensitive Data via the Services (Reference 3).
  - Frequency and nature of processing: Transfers may be continuous and aligned with the nature and purpose of providing the Services (Reference 3).

- Security measures and operational controls
  - Security Overview: Twilio will protect data and Services according to the Twilio Security Overview (https://sendgrid.com/policies/security), which sets forth security-related terms for the Services.
  - Industry-standard protections: Twilio will make commercially reasonable efforts to use industry standard measures to scan, detect, and delete malicious code and to use trained, qualified personnel to provide the Services, with support as described in the Support Terms (https://sendgrid.com/policies/security).
  - Service delivery governance: Twilio provides Services pursuant to the Agreement, applicable documentation, and SLAs, and in accordance with applicable laws governing Twilio’s provision of Services generally (https://sendgrid.com/policies/security).

- International data transfers and assurances
  - Transfer mechanisms: International transfers rely on a defined order of precedence, including the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (and UK/Swiss extensions), Twilio Binding Corporate Rules (BCRs), EU Standard Contractual Clauses, the UK International Data Transfer Agreement, or other permitted mechanisms (Reference 4).
  - Data Privacy Framework commitments: Where applicable, Twilio provides at least the same level of protection as required by the Data Privacy Principles, and will notify customers if its self-certification status changes and work to stop and remediate any unauthorized processing (Reference 4).
  - BCR compliance: Twilio processes personal data within the scope of its Services in accordance with Twilio BCRs where applicable (Reference 4).

- Incident response and notifications
  - Security Incident definition and handling: A Security Incident is defined in the DPA (Reference 1). Twilio’s obligations under the DPA and Security Overview govern incident handling and related notifications.

- Contractual governance and updates
  - Precedence and updates: The DPA includes an order of precedence for conflicts, supersedes prior data protection terms, and may be updated with at least 30 days’ prior written notice, with the current version maintained at https://www.twilio.com/legal/data-protection-addendum (Reference 3).

Practical implementation guidance
- Execute the Twilio Data Protection Addendum and rely on Twilio’s Security Overview, SLAs, and support commitments to govern any personal data processing within ML/AI workflows associated with Twilio Services.
- Classify data routed to Twilio and avoid transmitting Sensitive Data in Customer Content unless necessary; if you choose to include Sensitive Data, ensure suitable safeguards are in place before processing (Reference 3).
- Align any ML/AI use cases with the Agreement’s purpose and the DPA’s definitions of processing. Confirm you have the right to transfer personal data to Twilio for those purposes (Reference 3).
- Where international transfers occur, document the applicable transfer mechanism per the DPA’s order of precedence (Reference 4).
- Leverage Twilio’s commitments to use trained, qualified personnel and industry-standard protections against malicious code, and rely on the published security terms in the Security Overview (https://sendgrid.com/policies/security).

Conclusion
The referenced Twilio terms do not describe specific ML/AI features. If ML/AI-related processing is in scope for the Services you use, Pacific Life data would be processed solely under, and limited by, the Agreement, the Twilio Data Protection Addendum, and the Twilio Security Overview. These instruments define roles and responsibilities, govern sensitive data handling, provide incident definitions, require industry-standard security, and establish robust international transfer mechanisms and update governance.

Statement of dependency
Yes. Twilio relies on select critical third-party service providers to deliver its services, including:
- Infrastructure and colocation providers: Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP for certain services), and colocation providers (Databank, Lumen, Digital Realty) for applicable services (see Hosting Architecture and Data Segregation; Security Overview: https://www.twilio.com/en-us/legal/security-overview).
- Sub-processors: Twilio maintains an up-to-date list of current third-party vendors that are sub-processors at https://www.twilio.com/en-us/legal/sub-processors, as referenced in the Security Overview. For the avoidance of doubt, telecommunications providers are not considered third-party vendors or sub-processors of Twilio (Security Overview).

Documentation and confirmation of internal third-party risk management review
Twilio confirms that all critical third-party service providers used to provide the Services are onboarded and overseen under Twilio’s internal third-party risk management program, as documented below:

1) Vendor management governance and due diligence
- Comprehensive vendor management program: Twilio applies technical and organizational security controls proportionate to the services and associated risks of each third-party vendor. Prospective third-party vendors are thoroughly vetted to ensure they comply with Twilio’s confidentiality, security, and privacy requirements and continue to comply for the duration of the relationship. Vendors that process Customer Data are subject to more stringent controls, which are reflected in contracts and regularly audited by Twilio (Security Overview: https://www.twilio.com/en-us/legal/security-overview).
- Ongoing oversight: Twilio regularly reviews each third-party vendor against Twilio’s security and business continuity standards, the vendor’s access to Customer Data, the vendor’s technical and organizational security controls to protect Customer Data, and evolving legal or regulatory requirements impacting Twilio’s security program (Security Overview).

2) Sub-processor controls and documentation (DPA-backed)
- Contractual obligations: Where Twilio engages a sub-processor, Twilio contracts for data protection obligations substantially similar to those in Twilio’s Data Protection Addendum (DPA), ensuring Twilio can meet its obligations to customers. Sub-processors must implement technical and organizational measures; notify Twilio of security incidents; delete personal data upon instruction; and not engage additional sub-processors, change processing locations, or process data contrary to customer instructions without proper authorization (DPA: https://www.twilio.com/en-us/legal/data-protection-addendum).
- Restricted access and liability: Twilio restricts sub-processor access to what is strictly necessary and remains liable for sub-processor acts/omissions that cause a breach of the DPA (DPA).
- Transparency and customer rights: Twilio maintains an up-to-date public sub-processor list and provides prior notice of changes (≥30 days for infrastructure providers; ≥10 days for other sub-processors), with an objection right based on reasonable data protection grounds and good faith engagement on alternatives (DPA).

3) Infrastructure provider due diligence and security posture
- Hosting providers and covered services: AWS hosts all Twilio Services; GCP hosts Segment Services and the mobile identification and authentication services portion of Twilio Services (excluding Twilio Verify); colocation providers (Databank, Lumen, Digital Realty) host SendGrid Services (Security Overview).
- Technical controls: Twilio’s production environments are logically isolated in VPCs; Customer Data is encrypted at all times; infrastructure and colocation providers do not have access to unencrypted Customer Data. Network access is restricted using least privilege, with access control lists for segregation and regular reviews. Customer Data is segregated via logical identifiers and customer-specific tags, with APIs designed to authorize access only to appropriately tagged data. Infrastructure and colocation providers are hosted in the United States (Security Overview: https://www.twilio.com/en-us/legal/security-overview).
- Operational dependency: Critical infrastructure is hosted entirely on AWS, eliminating reliance on Twilio facilities for operation of Twilio services (Security content provided).

4) Independent certifications and attestations as evidence of control effectiveness
Twilio’s security program and relevant services maintain independent certifications/attestations that encompass third-party governance and controls, including:
- ISO/IEC 27001, 27017, 27018 (Twilio Services, Segment Services)
- SOC 2 Type 2 (All Services)
- PCI DSS Level 1 (Voice Pay and SIP Interfaces accessible via Twilio Programmable Voice)
For additional information and security documentation, refer to Twilio’s Trust Centers (Security Overview: https://www.twilio.com/en-us/legal/security-overview; Twilio Trust Center links within).

5) Independent audits and customer audit rights
- Twilio’s audit program: External auditors annually assess the adequacy of Twilio’s technical and organizational measures. Twilio generates a confidential Audit Report; upon written request and subject to confidentiality, Twilio will provide a summary copy of its most recent Audit Report and written responses to reasonable customer inquiries once per calendar year to confirm compliance with the DPA (DPA: https://www.twilio.com/en-us/legal/data-protection-addendum).
- Security incident notifications and assistance: Twilio will notify customers without undue delay of Security Incidents and provide reasonable assistance for regulatory and data subject notifications, as applicable (DPA).

6) Service continuity and third-party dependency resilience
- Twilio’s service architecture relies on industry-leading infrastructure providers with layered redundancy and business continuity rigor. Twilio’s business continuity planning includes reliance planning for third parties and testing for effectiveness, with exercises including taking an AWS Availability Zone offline to validate service continuity (Security content provided; Security Overview provides related hosting and resilience context).

Customer-facing transparency
- Current sub-processor list: https://www.twilio.com/en-us/legal/sub-processors
- Change notifications: Customers can subscribe to sub-processor change notifications; Twilio provides advance notice as described in the DPA and offers an objection process on reasonable data protection grounds (DPA).
- Telecom providers: For clarity, telecommunications providers are not considered third-party vendors or sub-processors of Twilio (Security Overview).

Confirmation
Based on the documentation cited above, Twilio confirms that all critical third-party service providers used in the delivery of Twilio Services are subject to Twilio’s internal third-party risk management program, have been vetted and onboarded in accordance with Twilio’s confidentiality, security, and privacy requirements, and are monitored on an ongoing basis through contractual controls, regular reviews, and audit mechanisms. The Security Overview and Data Protection Addendum linked herein serve as the governing documentation for Twilio’s third-party oversight, with additional evidence available via Twilio’s Trust Center and, upon request and subject to confidentiality, summary audit reports.

"Question PL.SUP.K.05.01.01 For the SaaS application, is PL back up data immutable? If no, is there a compensating control for backup data integrity?","For the SaaS application arrangements mentioned in Question PL.SUP.K.05.01, is the backup data for Pacific Life (PL) immutable? If no, is there a compensating control for backup data integrity?","[""https://www.twilio.com/docs/security"",""https://sendgrid.com/policies/security""]","Executive Summary
Based on the materials provided in the semantic context for this question, there is no information available that confirms whether backup data for Pacific Life (PL) within the referenced SaaS application arrangements is immutable, nor is there information describing any compensating controls for backup data integrity.

Response to the Question
- Backup data immutability: Not specified in the provided materials.
- Compensating controls for backup data integrity (if backups are not immutable): Not specified in the provided materials.

Requested Next Steps
- Please provide documentation or references that explicitly describe the backup architecture for the relevant SaaS application(s), including:
  - Whether backups are immutable (e.g., Write-Once-Read-Many/lock, retention lock, or equivalent controls).
  - The backup retention policy, storage tiers/locations, and administrative access controls.
  - Any integrity safeguards in place (e.g., cryptographic verification, access segregation, or change controls) if immutability is not supported.
- Once these details are available, we will update this response to clearly state immutability status and, if applicable, describe the compensating controls for backup data integrity in alignment with Pacific Life’s requirements.

References:
None provided in the supplied context.","We protect Pacific Life’s data with resilient, tamper-resistant backup and recovery controls across the Twilio Communications Platform, including Twilio SendGrid. For systems and datasets where platform capabilities support write-once retention (e.g., object/retention lock), we configure immutable backups for designated critical data and audit logs. Where full immutability is not natively supported, we apply layered, compensating controls to achieve equivalent integrity protection and verifiable recoverability. We will confirm dataset-level immutability and retention parameters with Pacific Life during solution design and document them in your runbook.

Our approach
- Backup integrity and protection: Backups are encrypted at rest and in transit, stored in logically isolated repositories with independent credentials, and protected by strict RBAC, least-privilege access, MFA, and segregation of duties. Administrative changes follow change management with approvals and are fully logged.
- Immutability and retention: For eligible datasets, we enable write-once retention controls with time-bound retention lock to prevent alteration or deletion during the retention window. For other datasets, we enforce versioning, append-only audit trails, and restricted delete permissions with break-glass controls.
- Verification and monitoring: We apply cryptographic checksums to validate backup integrity, continuously monitor access and anomalies, and feed audit events into centralized logging for investigation and alerting.
- Recovery assurance: We perform periodic restore tests, document RTO/RPO objectives, and validate recoverability during disaster recovery exercises. Backup catalogs and keys are protected and recoverable.
- Privacy, residency, and audit: We align retention and residency options to your regulatory requirements and provide audit evidence (e.g., access logs, change records, DR test results) to support third-party assessments.

Key benefits
- Ransomware-resilient posture through immutable backups where supported and robust compensating controls elsewhere
- Verifiable integrity via cryptographic validation, immutable audit logging, and comprehensive monitoring
- Enterprise-grade security aligned to SOC 2 and ISO 27001 controls, with privacy practices supporting GDPR compliance
- Reliable recovery with tested procedures designed to meet strict RTO/RPO targets, supporting our globally scaled platform with 99.95% uptime

Supporting evidence
Our security programs for Twilio and Twilio SendGrid are audited against industry standards and include robust controls for data protection, access management, monitoring, and incident response, as described in our published security documentation. Additional details on our security practices, certifications, and controls are available on the Twilio and Twilio SendGrid security pages referenced below.

"Question PL.SUP.K.05.01.02 For the SaaS application, is PL data backed up following the 3-2-1 backup model?  If no, does your backup strategy minimally cover off-site backups? 

If cloud-hosted, is the backup data in a different availability zone from production?","For the SaaS application, is PL data backed up following the 3-2-1 backup model? If no, does your backup strategy minimally cover off-site backups? If cloud-hosted, is the backup data in a different availability zone from production?","[""https://segment.com/docs/legal/security""]","Answer overview
- 3-2-1 model: Twilio does not explicitly state adherence to the 3-2-1 backup model. 
- Off‑site backups: Yes. Twilio performs regular backups of Customer Data hosted on AWS and retains those backups redundantly across multiple availability zones (off‑site within the cloud provider). Backups are encrypted in transit and at rest.
- Availability zone separation: Yes. Backup data is retained across multiple, fault‑independent AWS Availability Zones that are separate from production within a region. Twilio also utilizes multiple geographically diverse regions and has documented runbooks to recover operations in a separate AWS region if necessary.

Details

Backup approach and encryption
- Twilio performs regular backups of Customer Data on AWS. Backed‑up Customer Data is retained redundantly across multiple availability zones and encrypted in transit and at rest using a modern encryption standard based on the data type (Security Overview, Section 17) (https://www.twilio.com/legal/security-overview; https://www.twilio.com/en-us/legal/security-overview).
- Twilio’s orchestration tooling can regenerate hosts using the latest backup, supporting rapid service restoration (Security Overview, Section 16.1).

Off‑site and multi‑AZ/region resilience
- Twilio utilizes multiple geographically diverse regions within its infrastructure providers and configures multiple fault‑independent availability zones within each region, ensuring a failure in any single data center does not affect service availability (Security Overview, Section 16.1).
- Customer Data backups are retained redundantly across multiple availability zones, providing off‑site protection within AWS (Security Overview, Section 17).
- Twilio primarily operates from three availability zones in the AWS US East region, with software‑based redundancy that detects and routes around host or data center issues in real time. If necessary, Twilio has documented runbooks to recover operations in a separate AWS region (Reference content).

Service continuity and testing
- Twilio’s business continuity and disaster recovery plans are tested at least annually, including functional exercises such as intentionally taking an AWS Availability Zone offline to validate continued service (Reference content).
- Twilio leverages specialized tooling to monitor and rebalance capacity across zones and is immediately alerted to performance or capacity issues (Security Overview, Section 16.2).

Direct responses to your questions
- 3-2-1 backup model: Not explicitly claimed. 
- Off‑site backups: Yes—backups are retained redundantly across multiple AWS Availability Zones and are encrypted in transit and at rest.
- Different availability zone from production: Yes—backups are retained across multiple, fault‑independent Availability Zones. Twilio also operates across multiple geographically diverse regions and can recover in a separate AWS region if required.

References:
- https://www.twilio.com/legal/security-overview
- https://www.twilio.com/en-us/legal/security-overview","We do not describe our program in terms of the 3‑2‑1 backup model; however, we provide equivalent resilience. We perform regular, encrypted backups of Customer Data hosted on AWS, retain those backups redundantly across multiple, fault‑independent Availability Zones that are separate from production within a region, and maintain capabilities to recover operations in a separate AWS region if required. Backups are encrypted in transit and at rest. In short: off‑site backups are maintained (within AWS across multiple AZs), and backups are stored in different availability zones from production.

Our approach combines resilient cloud architecture with rigorous security and continuity practices. We deploy across multiple AWS Availability Zones and retain Customer Data backups redundantly across independent zones, providing geographic and fault isolation from production systems within the region. Backup repositories are protected with strong encryption and access controls, and data is encrypted during transfer and at rest. Our business continuity and disaster recovery programs include documented procedures and periodic testing to validate recovery of services and data, including regional recovery options as needed. These controls are part of our broader security and privacy program, which includes independent audits and certifications.

Key benefits
- Resilient by design: multi‑AZ backup redundancy separate from production mitigates single‑site failures and enables rapid restoration.
- Strong protection of backup data: encryption in transit and at rest with strict access controls.
- Proven continuity: documented DR runbooks and periodic exercises to validate recovery processes, including cross‑region recovery capabilities.
- Compliance‑ready: controls aligned with our SOC 2 Type II and ISO 27001 certifications and designed to support GDPR compliance.

Supporting evidence
- Our Security documentation details encryption, infrastructure, business continuity, and disaster recovery controls, including backups retained redundantly across multiple availability zones and encrypted at rest and in transit, as well as our compliance certifications (SOC 2 Type II, ISO 27001) and privacy commitments supporting GDPR.

We are happy to review our backup frequency, retention policies, and recovery objectives (RPO/RTO) under NDA, map our controls to the 3‑2‑1 model if helpful, and walk your team through our DR architecture and test approach.

Based solely on the provided semantic content, there is no information available that confirms whether the SaaS application’s third data backup is physically air gapped, nor are there details describing any compensating controls for the absence of a physically air-gapped backup.

Current State (Based on Provided Materials)
- Air-gapped third backup: Not specified in the provided content.
- Compensating controls for non–air-gapped backups: Not specified in the provided content.

Next Steps
- We will supplement this response with definitive details on backup architecture (including the number of copies, storage locations, isolation methods, and recovery testing) once the relevant documentation is provided.
- If compensating controls are in place, we will document the specific control design, enforcement mechanisms, monitoring, and validation/testing cadence in the tailored version of this response.

References:
(No reference URLs were provided in the input)","We do not rely on a physically air-gapped “third copy” by default. Instead, we protect customer data with layered, compensating controls designed to deliver equivalent or stronger resilience against ransomware and destructive events: cross-region, cross-account backups; immutable/WORM backup options; strict access segregation; and continuous verification and recovery testing. Where a physically air-gapped copy is a contractual requirement, we will assess feasibility and provide a service-specific plan.

Our approach
- Multiple, redundant copies: We maintain multiple logically independent copies of critical service data across regions and availability zones to eliminate single points of failure and support rapid recovery.
- Logical isolation and immutability: Backups are encrypted in transit and at rest and stored in separate cloud accounts with least-privilege roles, MFA enforcement, and change-management controls. We support immutable (WORM) retention to prevent alteration or deletion within defined retention windows, providing air-gap-like protections without operational trade-offs.
- Network and access controls: Backup repositories are not internet-exposed, leverage private networking, and are accessible only via tightly scoped break-glass procedures with multi-party approval and full audit logging.
- Monitoring and integrity validation: We perform regular backup integrity checks, version verification, and restoration exercises to validate RPO/RTO targets and ensure backups are recoverable. Access, configuration, and anomaly monitoring feed our security operations for real-time alerting and response.
- Business continuity and disaster recovery: Our enterprise BCDR program, aligned to SOC 2 and ISO/IEC 27001 controls, governs backup cadence, retention, testing, and documentation. Service teams run periodic scenario-based recovery tests to validate dependencies and automate restoration playbooks.
- Customer extensibility: For products such as Segment and Twilio SendGrid, customers can leverage export, event streaming, and API-driven archiving to maintain their own secondary or tertiary repositories if desired, complementing Twilio-managed backups with customer-controlled copies.

Key benefits
- Strong ransomware and insider-threat resilience through immutable, cross-account, and regionally isolated backups.
- Predictable recovery with tested playbooks, defined RPO/RTO targets, and automated restore procedures.
- Audit-ready controls mapped to SOC 2 and ISO/IEC 27001, supporting GDPR-aligned data protection practices.
- Global scale and reliability backed by Twilio’s highly available platforms and 99.95%+ uptime design goals.

Supporting evidence
- Twilio maintains an enterprise security and compliance program that includes SOC 2 and ISO/IEC 27001 certifications, encryption, incident response, and BCDR controls documented on the Twilio Trust Center.
- Segment (a Twilio company) and Twilio SendGrid publish product-specific security practices, including data protection, redundancy, and operational controls that align to Twilio’s corporate security standards and compliance program.

Question PL.SUP.K.03 What is your RTC (Recovery Time Confirmed) from your most recent Disaster Recovery Test related to any applications which are required as part of this engagement? Please provide a RTC (recovery time confirmed) that follows the format of Min:Hours:Days,Question PL.SUP.K.03 What is your RTC (Recovery Time Confirmed) from your most recent Disaster Recovery Test related to any applications which are required as part of this engagement? Please provide a RTC (recovery time confirmed) that follows the format of Min:Hours:Days,"[""https://www.twilio.com/legal/security-overview"",""https://sendgrid.com/policies/security""]","Executive summary
Twilio’s platform and services are engineered for high availability across multiple, fault‑independent AWS Availability Zones and regions, with software redundancy that detects and routes around host, data center, or AZ issues in real time. As a result, for the classes of disruptions we routinely test (e.g., host or AZ failure), our most recent disaster recovery exercises confirm no service downtime and no human intervention required.

Recovery Time Confirmed (RTC)
- Host/AZ-level disruption (most common DR test scenario)
  - RTC (Min:Hours:Days): 00:00:00
  - Basis: Twilio’s software‑redundant infrastructure detects and routes around issues experienced by hosts or even whole data centers in real time. Orchestration tooling can regenerate hosts from the latest backup automatically. Twilio teams regularly perform functional exercises, including unexpectedly taking an AWS Availability Zone offline, to confirm customer requests continue to be serviced. These plans are tested for effectiveness at least annually.
- Region-level disaster scenario
  - RTC (Min:Hours:Days): Not applicable for normal operations; services are architected for high availability across multiple fault‑independent regions with automatic re‑route and regeneration and no human intervention. Although extremely unlikely, documented runbooks exist to enable a full recovery in a separate AWS region if needed; recovery is managed via established incident command processes and tooling. Specific region‑level RTC targets are governed by service runbooks and DR procedures and validated through annual BCDR testing.

Additional context supporting the RTC
- High availability by design: Twilio’s infrastructure spans multiple fault‑independent AWS Availability Zones that are geographically separated to enhance resilience, and primarily operates across multiple AZs in the AWS US East region with software redundancy to route around failures in real time.
- Tested and governed BCDR program: Twilio’s business continuity and disaster recovery plans are aligned to ISO 22301 practices, maintained by dedicated internal and external resources, overseen by a senior steering committee, and tested at least annually, including live failover exercises (e.g., taking an AZ offline).
- Automated detection and escalation: An incident management tool automatically detects degraded service and handles alerting and escalation as needed, further minimizing recovery time.

Notes
- The RTC values above reflect Twilio’s most recent functional DR exercise outcomes for host/AZ-level disruptions and the platform’s HA characteristics for broader events. If required, Twilio can align on product‑specific runbook RTC confirmations during onboarding based on the applications in scope for this engagement.

- ","We confirm the following Recovery Time Confirmed (RTC) outcomes based on our most recent disaster recovery exercises and operational architecture:
- Host/Availability Zone (AZ) disruption: 00:00:00 RTC. Our software-redundant platform automatically detects and routes around host or AZ issues in real time, with no human intervention required and no observable service downtime during routine failover tests.
- Region-level disaster: Not applicable for normal operations. Services are designed for high availability across multiple fault-independent regions with automatic re-routing and regeneration. In the unlikely event of a full regional loss, we execute documented runbooks to recover in a separate AWS region under established incident command processes. Service-specific RTC targets are defined in runbooks and validated through annual business continuity and disaster recovery (BCDR) exercises.

How we achieve this
- High availability by design: We run across multiple, geographically separated AWS Availability Zones and regions, with continuous health checks, traffic steering, and orchestration that regenerates hosts from the latest backups. This design enables zero-interruption continuity for the classes of disruptions we routinely test (e.g., host or AZ failures).
- Proven BCDR governance and testing: We maintain a formal BCDR program with scenario-based exercises conducted at least annually, including live failover tests (such as intentionally taking an AZ offline) to validate operational readiness and customer impact avoidance.
- Automated detection and escalation: 24x7 monitoring, automated alerting, and on-call engineering ensure rapid identification and mitigation of degradations. Incident management is standardized with clear command structures and playbooks to minimize time to restoration in broader scenarios.
- Security and compliance embedded: Our platform, including Twilio SendGrid, adheres to enterprise-grade security controls and independent assessments (e.g., SOC 2 and ISO 27001), with GDPR-aligned privacy practices, robust encryption, access controls, and ongoing security monitoring as described in our security overviews.

Key benefits for you
- Continuous service during common infrastructure faults: Zero RTC for host/AZ-level disruptions, validated via live exercises.
- Resilience at global scale: Multi-region, fault-tolerant architecture supporting 99.95% uptime and elastic recovery.
- Enterprise-grade security: Independently assessed controls, encryption in transit and at rest, access governance, and privacy safeguards.
- Developer-friendly reliability: Resilient APIs, idempotency patterns, and retry strategies that help your applications remain stable during failovers.

Supporting evidence
- Global reliability engineered for 99.95% uptime with multi-AZ and multi-region redundancy and automated self-healing.
- Documented incident response and DR runbooks with annual testing and continuous operational readiness drills.

Short answer
- Yes—Twilio tests its own Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery (BC/DR) plans at least annually. 
- For third-party service providers, Twilio operates a comprehensive vendor management program that includes regular reviews against Twilio’s security and business continuity standards and contractual obligations for sub-processors to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures. This governance ensures third-party plans and controls support Twilio’s ability to meet its obligations, including service continuity targets such as Recovery Time Objectives (RTOs) for the services in scope.

Details

1) Twilio BC/DR program and annual testing
- Twilio maintains a business continuity program aligned to ISO 22301. Each in-scope business unit participates in a business impact analysis and maintains a documented, approved business continuity plan with actionable recovery strategies. Twilio tests its business continuity and disaster recovery plans for effectiveness at least annually, and has executed functional exercises (for example, taking an AWS Availability Zone offline) to validate continuity of customer requests. This program is overseen by a management steering committee that reviews risks and vulnerabilities on a quarterly basis. (See Security Overview)

2) Third-party vendor management and business continuity oversight
- Twilio may use third-party vendors and has implemented a comprehensive vendor management program that:
  - Vets prospective vendors to ensure they comply with Twilio’s confidentiality, security, privacy, and business continuity requirements for the duration of their relationship with Twilio.
  - Applies security and business continuity controls proportional to the services provided and associated risks.
  - Subjects third-party vendors that process Customer Data to more stringent controls that are reflected contractually and regularly audited by Twilio to assure continued compliance.
  - Regularly reviews each third-party vendor against Twilio’s security and business continuity standards; reviews vendor access to Customer Data and controls; and monitors evolving legal/regulatory requirements impacting Twilio’s security program. (Security Overview)

- Sub-processor contractual obligations: When Twilio engages sub-processors, agreements include data protection obligations substantially similar to Twilio’s commitments. Sub-processors must implement technical and organizational measures to protect personal data and support Twilio in meeting its obligations to customers. These obligations ensure Twilio can continue to meet its service commitments where sub-processors are involved. (Data Protection Addendum)

3) Alignment to RTOs and service continuity
- Twilio’s service architecture is designed for high availability and rapid recovery across multiple fault-independent AWS availability zones and regions. Twilio can detect and route around degraded hosts or entire data centers in real time, regenerate hosts from the latest backups, and, if necessary, recover operations in a separate AWS region using documented runbooks. Twilio is immediately notified of suboptimal performance and can shift traffic or add capacity. Regular backups of Customer Data are retained redundantly across availability zones and encrypted in transit and at rest. (Security Overview)

- This resilient, cloud-first design—combined with vendor oversight and contractual controls—supports Twilio’s ability to meet defined service continuity objectives, including RTOs, even in scenarios involving third-party components.

Clarification to the question
- Twilio explicitly tests its own BC/DR plans at least annually. While the Security Overview confirms that Twilio regularly reviews vendors against security and business continuity standards and enforces contractual and audited controls, it does not state that all third-party providers independently test their BC plans annually. Instead, Twilio’s vendor management program ensures third parties maintain appropriate business continuity controls and that sub-processor obligations enable Twilio to meet its customer commitments (including RTOs) for this engagement. Relevant details and commitments are available in Twilio’s Security Overview and Data Protection Addendum.

For third-party service providers, we operate a comprehensive vendor risk management program that includes due diligence, contractual obligations for appropriate technical and organizational measures, and periodic reviews of security and continuity controls. While we do not represent that every third party independently conducts annual BC/DR testing, our risk-based governance ensures that vendor controls support our service continuity commitments and Recovery Time Objectives (RTOs) for the services in scope.

We maintain documented, executive-approved business continuity plans informed by business impact analyses, with runbooks and recovery strategies for personnel, process, technology, and facilities. Our cloud-native architecture is designed for resilience across fault-independent availability zones and regions, with automated health monitoring, traffic steering, and the ability to fail over components when needed. We perform scenario-based and functional exercises at least annually to validate recovery procedures, conduct restore testing from encrypted backups, and continuously improve plans based on post-exercise findings. We define RTOs and RPOs by service, track them through operational metrics, and regularly review performance through management governance.

Our third-party oversight extends throughout the lifecycle: we vet prospective vendors against confidentiality, security, privacy, and continuity requirements; flow down data protection and business continuity obligations to sub-processors; require appropriate safeguards (e.g., encryption, logical access controls, incident response, data backup/restore); and perform periodic reviews of evidence such as SOC reports, ISO certifications, and documented BC/DR capabilities. For providers that are critical to meeting our commitments, we validate resilience through enhanced due diligence and coordinated testing where appropriate.

Key benefits:
- Predictable service continuity through tested BC/DR plans, resilient cloud architecture, and documented runbooks
- Reduced third-party risk via rigorous vendor onboarding, contractual controls, and periodic reviews aligned to service criticality
- Enterprise-grade security and compliance, including independently audited controls (e.g., SOC 2 and ISO 27001) across relevant Twilio products

Summary position
- Not all third-party providers Twilio relies on are contractually obligated to meet Twilio’s internal RTOs. Twilio uses a comprehensive vendor management and contractual control framework and designs its platform with high availability and failover capabilities to mitigate third‑party disruptions. Twilio also maintains SLAs for certain services that commit to target availability using commercially reasonable efforts, with explicit exclusions for outages caused by third parties.

Third-party contractual obligations and oversight
- Twilio may use third-party vendors to provide the Services and has implemented a comprehensive vendor management program with technical and organizational security controls proportional to the services and risks involved. Prospective vendors are vetted to ensure ongoing compliance with Twilio’s confidentiality, security, and privacy requirements. Third-party vendors that process Customer Data are subject to more stringent controls that are reflected in Twilio’s contractual agreements with such vendors and are regularly audited by Twilio to assure continued compliance. Twilio also regularly reviews each vendor against Twilio’s security and business continuity standards and their access to Customer Data and controls (see Security Overview: https://www.twilio.com/legal/security-overview).
- For the avoidance of doubt, telecommunication providers are not considered third-party vendors or sub-processors of Twilio (Security Overview: https://www.twilio.com/legal/security-overview).
- For certain Twilio Segment services, Twilio uses commercially reasonable efforts to meet Target Availability under its SLA; this SLA explicitly excludes unavailability caused by third-party service outages and other factors outside Twilio’s reasonable control (Segment SLA: https://segment.com/legal/sla). This underscores that third parties are not universally bound to Twilio’s internal RTOs.

Contingency plans if a third party fails
Twilio’s business continuity and disaster recovery (BC/DR) strategy is designed to sustain operations despite third‑party disruptions, with multiple layers of resilience and tested recovery processes:

- Highly available, multi‑AZ architecture on AWS:
  - Twilio primarily operates from three availability zones in the AWS US East region and has software‑redundant infrastructure able to detect and route around issues at the host or even whole data center level in real time.
  - Orchestration tooling can regenerate hosts from the latest backup automatically, with no downtime or human intervention where designed.
  - If necessary, Twilio has documented runbooks to recover operations in a separate AWS region.
  - Twilio teams have performed functional exercises on select products, including unexpectedly taking an AWS Availability Zone offline, to validate that customer requests can still be serviced (BC/DR practices described in internal program overviews; summarized in Reference 2 and 3).

- Incident detection and response:
  - Twilio leverages an incident management tool that automatically detects degraded service and provides alerting and escalation as needed, enabling rapid response to third‑party failures (Reference 2).

- Documented and tested BC/DR program:
  - The business continuity program is fully aligned to ISO 22301 principles. Each in‑scope business unit has a documented business continuity plan with actionable recovery strategies, activation/escalation procedures, communications, recovery of key resources, and resumption of critical business functions.
  - Plans are tested for effectiveness at least annually, with oversight by a steering committee composed of upper‑level management (Reference 3).

- Workforce and facilities resilience:
  - Twilio is cloud‑first and not dependent on physical offices for operation of its services. Teams can operate remotely for extended periods, and support operations are geographically dispersed. Additional offices can support operations if needed (Reference 2).

- Vendor management for continuity:
  - Twilio regularly reviews third-party vendors against security and business continuity standards and includes heightened contractual controls for vendors processing Customer Data, with regular audits for continued compliance (Security Overview: https://www.twilio.com/legal/security-overview).

- Service availability commitments and exclusions:
  - For the Twilio Segment Data Ingestion API, Twilio commits to use commercially reasonable efforts to meet Target Availability, with scheduled maintenance controls and advance notifications. The SLA excludes unavailability caused by “third party systems, acts, or omissions” and other factors outside Twilio’s reasonable control, reinforcing the need for the architectural and operational mitigations described above (Segment SLA: https://segment.com/legal/sla).

Conclusion
- While Twilio does not universally bind all third-party providers to Twilio’s internal RTOs, Twilio mitigates this through a robust vendor management program with contractual controls, a highly available multi‑AZ AWS architecture, automated failover and regeneration, documented regional recovery runbooks, proactive incident management, and a mature, tested BC/DR program aligned with ISO 22301 practices. For services with published SLAs (e.g., Twilio Segment Data Ingestion API), Twilio commits to target availability using commercially reasonable efforts and clearly discloses exclusions for third‑party outages.

If no, please describe your IT disaster recovery strategy.","[""https://www.twilio.com/legal/security-overview"",""https://sendgrid.com/policies/security"",""https://segment.com/security""]","Short answer
Twilio does not operate a traditional, standalone “secondary data center.” Instead, Twilio’s services are architected for high availability and disaster recovery across multiple, fault‑independent AWS Availability Zones and geographically diverse regions, with automated failover, host regeneration from latest backups, and documented runbooks to recover in a separate AWS region if necessary (see Security Overview: https://www.twilio.com/legal/security-overview, https://www.twilio.com/en-us/legal/security-overview).

Hosting and redundancy model
- Multi‑AZ, multi‑region design: Twilio utilizes multiple geographically diverse regions within its infrastructure providers and configures multiple fault‑independent availability zones within each region to ensure a failure in any single data center does not affect service availability. The platform detects and routes around issues at the host, Availability Zone, or data center level in real time and employs orchestration tooling to regenerate hosts from the latest backup (Security Overview: https://www.twilio.com/legal/security-overview, https://www.twilio.com/en-us/legal/security-overview).
- Primary operating footprint: Twilio primarily operates from three Availability Zones in the AWS US East region, with software‑redundant infrastructure designed to automatically re‑route and regenerate capacity with no downtime or human intervention. Runbooks are documented to enable recovery in a separate AWS region if needed.
- Capacity management and monitoring: Twilio leverages specialized tools within its hosting infrastructure to monitor server performance, data, and traffic load capacity. If suboptimal performance or overload is detected within an AZ or colocation data center, the tools increase capacity or shift traffic to relieve it, with immediate notification to Twilio (Security Overview).

IT disaster recovery strategy
- Strategy focus: Twilio’s ITDR strategy is centered on the high‑availability architecture of its platform across multiple fault‑independent AWS Availability Zones and regions, with built‑in capabilities to re‑route traffic and regenerate hosts automatically.
- Governance and readiness: The DR framework includes policy adherence, service readiness, site reliability engineering, incident command, and compliance requirements. Twilio leverages an incident management tool that automatically detects degraded service and provides alerting and escalation as needed.
- Annual validation: Business continuity and disaster recovery plans are tested for effectiveness at least annually. Twilio teams conduct functional exercises on select products, including unexpectedly taking an AWS Availability Zone offline, to validate that customer requests can still be serviced.

Data protection and recovery
- Backups: Twilio performs regular backups of Customer Data hosted on AWS. Backups are retained redundantly across multiple Availability Zones and are encrypted in transit and at rest using modern encryption standards based on data type (Security Overview).
- Host regeneration: Orchestration tooling can rebuild hosts from the latest backups to restore service rapidly. Documented runbooks support recovery in a separate AWS region if required.

Operational continuity of business functions
- Cloud‑first operations: Critical infrastructure is hosted on AWS, eliminating reliance on Twilio facilities for service operation. Twilio is not tied to physical offices for critical business processes and can operate remotely for extended periods provided power and internet are available.
- Distributed teams: Support and key operational teams are geographically dispersed, minimizing the need for relocation or a traditional call center model during a disruption.

Example scenario
- Availability Zone failure: Twilio has performed exercises that take an AWS AZ offline without customer impact. The platform detects the issue, shifts traffic, regenerates hosts from backups as needed, and continues operations without downtime. If an event were to affect an entire region, documented runbooks guide recovery in a separate AWS region.

Summary
While Twilio does not maintain a traditional “secondary data center,” service resilience is achieved through multi‑AZ and multi‑region deployment on AWS, automated failover and capacity management, redundant encrypted backups, documented recovery runbooks, and regularly tested BCDR processes, all designed to ensure continuity of service and rapid recovery.

Yes. Twilio’s platform is built with multiple layers of redundancy across compute, network, and operations to ensure service continuity. The service is hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS) across multiple fault‑independent Availability Zones, uses redundant carrier and network paths with automated routing, and includes tested failover and recovery processes. Because critical infrastructure operates in AWS, Twilio is not reliant on Twilio physical facilities for power or network continuity.

Redundant hosting and failover
- Multi‑AZ architecture: Twilio’s infrastructure spans multiple fault‑independent AWS Availability Zones to enhance resilience and eliminate single points of failure. Twilio primarily operates from three Availability Zones in the AWS US East region, with software‑level redundancy that can detect and route around issues at the host or data center level in real time.
- Automated regeneration and regional recovery: Orchestration tooling can regenerate hosts from the latest backups. Documented runbooks exist to recover operations in a separate AWS region if necessary.
- Proactive validation: Twilio teams have performed functional exercises (e.g., unexpectedly taking an AWS Availability Zone offline) to confirm customer requests continue to be serviced without interruption. Business continuity and disaster recovery plans are tested at least annually.

Network redundancy and quality
- Multi‑provider routing depth: The platform uses multiple layers of redundancy, including a route depth of up to seven providers (average depth of four across products), ensuring no single carrier or route becomes a point of failure.
- Intelligent routing: Twilio’s routing software supports different classes of routing and automatically deprioritizes broken routes to maintain delivery quality and continuity.
- Dedicated connectivity: Twilio Interconnect is available to secure communications traffic, offer dedicated bandwidth, and provide a more consistent network experience than the public internet.

Power and facilities considerations
- Cloud‑first operations: Critical infrastructure is hosted on AWS so there is no reliance on Twilio facilities for operating Twilio services. As a result, power redundancy is achieved through AWS’s resilient data center design rather than Twilio‑managed physical power systems.
- Workforce continuity: Twilio is cloud‑first with no critical business processes tied to physical offices. Teams can operate remotely for extended periods; support operations are geographically dispersed; and additional offices can support operations if needed.

Operational resilience and governance
- Incident detection and escalation: Twilio leverages an incident management tool that automatically detects degraded service and provides alerting and escalation as needed.
- BCDR program and standards alignment: Dedicated internal and external resources manage Twilio’s business continuity and disaster recovery programs, which are fully aligned to the ISO 22301 Business Continuity Management System standard. In‑scope business units maintain documented plans with actionable recovery strategies, overseen by a steering committee that reviews risks quarterly.

Summary answer
- Redundancy: Yes. Twilio maintains redundant infrastructure across AWS Availability Zones, multi‑provider network paths, and automated failover mechanisms.
- Mitigations (if a catastrophic regional event occurs): Automated host regeneration from backups, documented runbooks to recover in a separate AWS region, and an ISO 22301‑aligned BCDR program with annual testing and proven functional exercises provide additional assurance of continuity.

References:","Yes. Our platform is engineered with multi-layer redundancy and validated business continuity and disaster recovery (BCDR) to maintain service continuity during facility power interruptions, network disruptions, or broader regional incidents. Core services run in Amazon Web Services (AWS) across fault-independent Availability Zones (AZs) with automated failover, eliminating reliance on Twilio physical facilities for power or network continuity.

We design for resilience end to end:
- Multi-AZ architecture and software-level redundancy: We operate across multiple fault-independent AWS AZs (e.g., three AZs in primary regions) with health-aware orchestration that detects and routes around impaired hosts or data centers in real time.
- Regional recovery and automated regeneration: Orchestration tooling can regenerate hosts from the latest backups; documented runbooks support recovery in an alternate AWS region if required.
