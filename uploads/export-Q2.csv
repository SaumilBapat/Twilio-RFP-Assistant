Can you confirm that no Q2 data or Q2 customer data has been exposed to security or privacy events given some of the recent news?,Can you confirm that no Q2 data or Q2 customer data has been exposed to security or privacy events given some of the recent news?,"[""https://www.twilio.com/security"",""https://sendgrid.com/policies/security"",""https://segment.com/security""]","Executive summary
Based on Twilio’s documented incident response and notification commitments, and the public details available regarding recent events, Twilio has no evidence that customer passwords, authentication tokens, or API keys were accessed without authorization, and only a limited subset of customers were impacted in the 2022 smishing incident. Twilio’s practice is to notify impacted customers without undue delay; if Q2 has not received a notification from Twilio, then Twilio has no evidence that Q2’s account was impacted.

Direct response to your question
- Confirmation status: Twilio’s incident communications state: “If a customer has not been contacted by Twilio, then it means that there is no evidence that their account was impacted by this attack.” There is “no evidence that customer passwords, authentication tokens, or API keys were accessed without authorization.” (https://www.twilio.com/blog/august-2022-social-engineering-attack)
- Notification commitment: Under Twilio’s Data Protection Addendum, Twilio will notify customers “without undue delay” of any Security Incident involving customer personal data and will provide reasonable assistance with any required notifications to regulators or data subjects (https://www.twilio.com/en-us/legal/data-protection-addendum).

Context on the “recent news” and scope of impact
- 2022 smishing/social engineering campaign: Twilio concluded its investigation of an SMS phishing (“smishing”) attack that led to unauthorized access to some internal non-production systems and certain customer data for a limited period. Identified impact included up to 163 Twilio customers (out of over 270,000) and 93 Authy users (out of ~75 million). Twilio notified all affected customers and Authy users, removed unauthorized devices from those Authy accounts, and instituted targeted security enhancements (https://www.twilio.com/blog/august-2022-social-engineering-attack).
- Importantly, Twilio reported “no evidence that the malicious actors accessed Twilio customers’ console account credentials, authentication tokens, or API keys.” If you were not contacted by Twilio, there is no evidence your account was impacted (https://www.twilio.com/blog/august-2022-social-engineering-attack).
- Trust Center updates: Twilio SendGrid is aware of third-party claims posted on forums; “there is no evidence to suggest that Twilio or Twilio SendGrid was breached,” and a sampling review indicated the referenced data did not originate from SendGrid. Twilio also disrupted phishing campaigns impersonating SendGrid and broke associated links (https://security.twilio.com/).

How Twilio protects your data (assurance)
- Proven security program and auditability:
  - External audits and reports (e.g., SOC 2, ISO 27001, PCI DSS) are available via the Twilio Trust Center, along with pen test reports and disaster recovery test results (https://security.twilio.com/).
  - Twilio’s DPA provides customer audit rights, annual third‑party audits, and access to summary audit reports upon request (https://www.twilio.com/en-us/legal/data-protection-addendum).
- Security-by-design and access controls:
  - Secure SDLC, independent penetration testing of new services, and threat modeling (https://www.twilio.com/legal/security-overview).
  - Least-privilege, time-bound access to production; MFA is required for authorized users; high‑risk actions are logged; automation alerts on deviations from standards (https://www.twilio.com/legal/security-overview).
- Data protection in hosting environments:
  - Services are hosted on leading providers; production environments are logically isolated (VPC), and customer data is encrypted at all times. Providers do not have access to unencrypted customer data. Network access is restricted and segregated; customer data is logically separated via unique identifiers (https://www.twilio.com/legal/security-overview).
- Segment and SendGrid security references:
  - Segment: encryption at rest and in transit, SSO/MFA, SCIM, rigorous security testing, and a vulnerability disclosure program (https://segment.com/security).
  - SendGrid: SOC 2 Type II attestation, defined data retention, vulnerability disclosure and bug bounty program (https://sendgrid.com/en-us/policies/security).

What we will do for Q2
- Validate notification status: If Q2 has not received a security incident notification from Twilio to the designated security contact(s), Twilio has no evidence of exposure of Q2 data per the 2022 incident updates and the DPA’s notification obligations.
- Provide assurance artifacts: Upon request, we will provide Trust Center access to SOC 2 reports, pen test summaries, bridge letters, and other security documentation to support Q2’s review (https://security.twilio.com/).
- Maintain ongoing communication: Per the DPA, Twilio will notify Q2 without undue delay should any incident involving Q2’s personal data be identified (https://www.twilio.com/en-us/legal/data-protection-addendum).

If you would like, we can coordinate a review session to walk through Trust Center artifacts and confirm the designated incident notification contacts on file.

Overview and governance
Twilio’s approach to encryption and the associated key management controls is governed by our Technical and Organizational Security Measures, as described in the Data Protection Addendum and Security Overview. Twilio documents measures for pseudonymisation and encryption of personal data and directs customers to the Encryption section of the Security Overview for details on encryption implementation (see Data Protection Addendum: https://www.twilio.com/en-us/legal/data-protection-addendum and Security Overview, Section 12 referenced therein). Twilio’s security program includes ongoing testing, assessment, and evaluation of technical and organizational measures, as well as security by design practices through the Twilio Secure SDLC (https://www.twilio.com/legal/security-overview).

Encryption controls and scope
- Measures for pseudonymisation and encryption of personal data: Twilio maintains measures for encryption and pseudonymisation of personal data, with specific encryption details covered in Section 12 (Encryption) of the Security Overview (referenced in the Data Protection Addendum: https://www.twilio.com/en-us/legal/data-protection-addendum).
- Protection of data in transit and at rest: Twilio’s Security Overview describes measures for protecting data during transmission and storage, pointing to Section 12 (Encryption) for encryption controls and Section 8 (Hosting Architecture and Data Segregation) for storage protections (as referenced in the Data Protection Addendum: https://www.twilio.com/en-us/legal/data-protection-addendum).

Access control over cryptographic material and production systems
Twilio enforces strict access controls over production environments where encryption services and key-related configurations are administered:
- Least privilege and approvals: Access to production environments is granted on a least privilege basis, requires management approval, and is restricted to job roles requiring such access (https://www.twilio.com/legal/security-overview).
- Strong authentication: Authorized users must have unique credentials and multi-factor authentication enabled to access production systems (https://www.twilio.com/legal/security-overview).
- Access reviews and revocation: Non-time-based access rights to production are reviewed at least quarterly, and access is promptly removed upon termination (https://www.twilio.com/legal/security-overview).
These controls help ensure that any administrative operations related to encryption configurations and key-handling processes in production are tightly governed.

Change management, logging, and monitoring
- High-risk action logging: Twilio logs high-risk actions and changes in the production environment of the Services, providing traceability over configuration changes that could impact encryption posture (https://www.twilio.com/legal/security-overview).
- Automated detection of deviations: Twilio leverages automation to identify deviations from internal technical standards and raises alerts within minutes of configuration changes, supporting rapid detection of anomalous or unauthorized activity that could affect encryption configurations or key management processes (https://www.twilio.com/legal/security-overview).
- Events logging: Twilio maintains measures for ensuring events logging, with references to service-specific logging capabilities (e.g., Verify and SendGrid) for visibility into operational events (https://www.twilio.com/en-us/legal/data-protection-addendum).

Security by design and verification
- Secure SDLC: Twilio applies a Secure Software Development Lifecycle across product creation, including security reviews prior to deployment, independent third-party penetration tests of new services, and threat modeling to detect potential security threats and vulnerabilities (https://www.twilio.com/legal/security-overview). These activities help ensure encryption features, controls, and related key-management interfaces are designed and verified with security in mind.
- Ongoing assessment: Twilio maintains processes for regularly testing, assessing, and evaluating the effectiveness of technical and organizational measures, as referenced in the Data Protection Addendum (https://www.twilio.com/en-us/legal/data-protection-addendum).

Resilience, backup, and recovery considerations
- Service continuity and backups: The Data Protection Addendum references measures for resilience, service continuity, and backups (Security Overview Sections 16 and 17). These measures support the ability to restore availability and access to personal data in the event of a physical or technical incident, which is foundational to a robust encryption and key management posture (https://www.twilio.com/en-us/legal/data-protection-addendum).

Roles and responsibilities
- Security organization and governance: Twilio’s internal IT and security governance, certifications, and attestations are described in the Security Overview and referenced by the Data Protection Addendum (https://www.twilio.com/en-us/legal/data-protection-addendum and https://www.twilio.com/legal/security-overview). This governance framework supports the policies and controls that underpin encryption and key management processes.

Customer assurance and documentation
- Documentation references: Details on encryption controls are documented in the Security Overview (Section 12), with additional references to hosting, access control, resilience, and backups throughout the Security Overview. The Data Protection Addendum maps these controls to specific GDPR-required measures and provides pointers to the relevant sections for encryption, access control, logging, resilience, and testing (https://www.twilio.com/en-us/legal/data-protection-addendum; https://www.twilio.com/legal/security-overview).

Summary
Twilio maintains documented measures for encryption and pseudonymisation of personal data and protects data in transit and at rest as described in the Security Overview. Access to production environments—where encryption configurations and key-related operations are managed—is tightly controlled using least privilege, MFA, formal approvals, periodic access reviews, and immediate revocation. Twilio logs high-risk changes, uses automation to detect configuration deviations, and applies Secure SDLC practices, third-party testing, and threat modeling to help ensure encryption controls remain effective. Resilience and backup measures further support the integrity and availability of encrypted data and related operational processes.

"Is any Q2 or Q2 customer data store, accessed, or processed in China?","Is any Q2 or Q2 customer data store, accessed, or processed in China, considering your company's policy on storing and accessing Q2 or Q2 customer data in non-US locations as mentioned in question 6?","[""https://www.twilio.com/legal/privacy"",""https://segment.com/docs/legal/privacy""]","Answer
Based on Twilio’s published Privacy Notice and Data Protection Addendum (DPA), Twilio’s primary processing facilities are located in the United States, and personal data may also be transferred to “other countries where we or our service providers operate,” subject to appropriate safeguards and applicable transfer mechanisms. The referenced materials do not identify China as a processing location. In addition, Twilio contractually restricts sub-processors from changing the location of processing without authorization and provides customers with notice and the opportunity to object or discontinue affected services if a sub-processor change impacts processing locations.

Therefore, under Twilio’s standard service model and policies referenced here, Q2 or Q2 customer data is primarily processed in the U.S.; any processing outside the U.S. occurs only where Twilio or its service providers operate and is governed by Twilio’s transfer safeguards. The materials provided do not indicate that Twilio stores, accesses, or processes data in China. If a service required connectivity in a specific jurisdiction due to telecommunications regulations, Twilio would comply with applicable law and limit any disclosures to the minimum extent necessary.

Details and safeguards
- Primary processing location: When customers use Twilio’s account portal or other services, personal data “may be transferred to the United States, where our primary processing facilities are located, and possibly to other countries where we or our service providers operate” (https://www.twilio.com/en-us/legal/privacy; https://segment.com/docs/legal/privacy/).
- Cross-border transfer mechanisms: Twilio employs appropriate safeguards for cross-border transfers and relies on mechanisms including the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (and UK/Swiss extensions), Binding Corporate Rules (BCRs), EU Standard Contractual Clauses, the UK International Data Transfer Agreement, and Brazilian SCCs, as applicable (https://www.twilio.com/en-us/legal/privacy; https://www.twilio.com/en-us/legal/data-protection-addendum; https://segment.com/docs/legal/privacy/).
- Binding Corporate Rules and APEC participation: Twilio’s BCRs govern internal transfers globally, and Twilio participates in APEC CBPR/PRP systems (https://www.twilio.com/en-us/legal/privacy).
- Sub-processor and location controls: Twilio requires sub-processors to (a) not change the location of processing; (b) not engage additional sub-processors without authorization; and (c) notify Twilio of security incidents so Twilio can notify customers. Twilio provides notice of sub-processor changes, allows customer objections within the notice period, and permits discontinuation of affected services if unresolved (https://www.twilio.com/en-us/legal/data-protection-addendum).
- Regulatory disclosures and local telecom requirements: Where required by law or regulation, subscriber records may be shared with local telecommunications providers or local government authorities, and Twilio limits any such disclosures to the minimum necessary and follows its law enforcement guidelines (https://www.twilio.com/en-us/legal/data-protection-addendum).
- Customer controls and auditability: Customers can review Twilio’s sub-processor list (linked in the DPA), exercise objection rights to changes, and leverage Twilio’s audit program and, if necessary, conduct a mutually agreed third-party audit to assess compliance with the DPA (https://www.twilio.com/en-us/legal/data-protection-addendum).

Conclusion
- The provided Twilio documents indicate U.S.-primary processing with potential transfers to other operating countries under strict safeguards. They do not specify China as a processing location. Sub-processor controls and notice/objection rights further protect against unapproved changes in processing location. If regulatory requirements in a given country mandate limited disclosures (e.g., via local telecom providers), Twilio complies to the minimum extent necessary and in line with its DPA and law enforcement guidelines.

Do you have published RTOs and RPOs?,"Do you have published Recovery Time Objectives (RTOs) and Recovery Point Objectives (RPOs) for your services, particularly in relation to data protection and security measures, considering the importance of maintaining data integrity and availability as highlighted in previous questions about data exposure, encryption, and data residency?","[""https://www.twilio.com/security"",""https://www.twilio.com/legal/privacy"",""https://sendgrid.com/policies/security"",""https://segment.com/docs/legal/security""]","Executive summary
Twilio does not publish fixed, numeric Recovery Time Objectives (RTOs) or Recovery Point Objectives (RPOs) per service in its public documentation. Instead, Twilio provides a comprehensive set of technical, organizational, and architectural controls designed to protect data integrity and ensure service availability, complemented by a documented Service Level Agreement (SLA) and a mature business continuity and disaster recovery (BCDR) program. The controls described below collectively support timely recovery of services and data in the event of a disruption.

Resilience, service continuity, and backup posture
- Multi-region, multi–availability zone architecture: Twilio utilizes multiple geographically diverse regions within its infrastructure providers and multiple fault‑independent availability zones within each region. This design detects and routes around issues at the host or even full data center level in real time, with orchestration tooling able to regenerate hosts from the latest backup (Security Overview, Sections 16.1–16.2; https://www.twilio.com/legal/security-overview).
- Continuous monitoring and automated failover: Specialized tools monitor server performance, data, and traffic load capacity; if suboptimal performance or overload is detected, capacity is increased or traffic is shifted to maintain service continuity (Security Overview, Section 16.2).
- Customer data backups and redundancy: Twilio performs regular backups of Customer Data hosted on AWS. Backups are retained redundantly across multiple availability zones and are encrypted in transit and at rest using modern encryption standards appropriate to the data type (Security Overview, Section 17). Additional materials emphasize redundant storage across AWS availability zones and regions in the U.S.
- Encryption and data protection: Data is encrypted in transit (e.g., TLS 1.2) and at rest, and backups are encrypted (including AES‑256), aligning with measures noted in the Data Protection Addendum and Security Overview.

Business continuity and disaster recovery governance
- ISO 22301–aligned BCDR program: Twilio maintains a business continuity program aligned to the ISO 22301 Business Continuity Management System standard. Each in‑scope business unit participates in business impact analyses and maintains actionable, approved continuity plans with activation, escalation, communication, recovery, and resumption strategies. A steering committee of senior management oversees the program, with risks and vulnerabilities addressed quarterly.
- Regular testing and real‑world exercises: Twilio conducts annual testing of its business continuity and disaster recovery plans. Teams have executed functional exercises on select products, including taking an AWS Availability Zone offline to confirm customer requests can still be serviced, demonstrating the platform’s ability to withstand zonal failures. Twilio also leverages incident management tooling for automatic detection, alerting, and escalation of degraded services.
- Disaster recovery framework: Twilio’s DR strategy ensures continuity of critical business functions within a predetermined time following a disruption, driven by policy adherence, service readiness, site reliability engineering, incident command, and compliance requirements.

Service availability commitments
- SLA-backed availability: Twilio offers a Service Level Agreement with a 99.99% uptime target, supported by multi‑AZ/region resiliency, proactive monitoring, traffic shifting, and orchestration capabilities that regenerate hosts from current backups to restore service quickly.

How these measures relate to RTO and RPO
- While specific, numeric RTO/RPO values are not published, Twilio’s documented controls directly address the ability to restore the availability and access to personal data in a timely manner following a physical or technical incident, as well as ensuring ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability, and resilience of processing systems and services (Data Protection Addendum pointing to Security Overview Sections 16 and 17).
- Practically, this is achieved through:
  - Regular, encrypted backups retained redundantly across multiple availability zones (Security Overview, Section 17).
  - Automated rerouting and host regeneration from the latest backup when failures occur (Security Overview, Section 16.1).
  - Proactive capacity management and traffic shifting to mitigate performance degradation (Security Overview, Section 16.2).
  - A tested, ISO 22301–aligned BCDR program with functional exercises simulating infrastructure failures.

Summary
- Published numeric RTO/RPOs: Not publicly published per service.
- What is published: A comprehensive resilience, backup, and continuity framework; encryption and data protection controls; regular testing; and a 99.99% SLA-backed availability commitment—together designed to maintain data integrity and availability and to support timely restoration of services and access to personal data after an incident.

References:
- https://www.twilio.com/en-us/legal/data-protection-addendum
