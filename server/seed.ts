Reference the source URLs when mentioning specific features or capabilities.\n\n4. **PROFESSIONAL TONE:** Write in a professional, confident tone appropriate for enterprise RFP responses.\n\n5. **STRUCTURED RESPONSE:** Organize content logically with clear sections and smooth transitions between concepts.\n\n6. **REFERENCES SECTION:** End with a 'References:' section listing the URLs from the Reference URLs section above.\n\n**Enhancement Note:** This semantic search approach ensures the most relevant content is selected based on conceptual similarity rather than simple keyword matching, providing higher quality, more contextually appropriate responses.\n\nThis is a generic draft that will be tailored with company-specific information in the final step."
